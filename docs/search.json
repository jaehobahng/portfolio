Attending international schools shaped my bilingual proficiency in English and Korean and taught me to embrace diversity with a global perspective. After 14 years abroad, I returned to Korea, earning a degree in economics from Sogang University. I then worked as a data analyst at an online fashion retail platform for four years. Currently, I’m pursuing a master’s in Data Science and Analytics at Georgetown University while working as a data analyst at Tractor Supply Company."
