**How I got here**<br>
Growing up as a third-culture kid, I moved every 2–3 years, living in Hong Kong, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, China, and Bangladesh. Attending international schools shaped my bilingual proficiency in English and Korean and taught me to embrace diversity with a global perspective. After 14 years abroad, I returned to Korea, earning a degree in economics from Sogang University. I then worked as a data analyst at an online fashion retail platform for four years. Currently, I’m pursuing a master’s in Data Science and Analytics at Georgetown University while working as a data analyst at Tractor Supply Company.
