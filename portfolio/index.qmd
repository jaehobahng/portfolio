## More About Me
As a third-culture kid, I spent my formative years moving every 2–3 years, living in vibrant and diverse places like Hong Kong, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, China, and Bangladesh. Attending international schools not only fostered my bilingual fluency in English and Korean but also instilled a deep appreciation for diversity and a global outlook. After 14 years abroad, I returned to Korea and earned a degree in economics from Sogang University. Following graduation, I gained four years of experience as a data analyst at an online fashion retail platform. Currently, I’m pursuing a master’s degree in Data Science and Analytics at Georgetown University while contributing as a data analyst at Tractor Supply Company.
