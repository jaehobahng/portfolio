  author: JaeHo Bahng
  description: >
    Created an LLM agent able to chat with sql databases utilizing postgres and Langchain. \
    A synthetic dataset was created to mimic real world e-commerce datasets. \ 
    Chatbot is able to read thorugh purchase data, article information, log data to answer questions and output csv files for the user to utilize.
