  description: >
    Designed a predictive model for Premier League football match outcomes, leveraging historical scores and home/away dynamics. The model estimates the likelihood of each team scoring a specific number of goals and combines these probabilities to forecast match results, determining wins, losses, or draws. The predictions achieved an 87% alignment with betting site forecasts and demonstrated a 63% accuracy against actual match results.    <br><br>
